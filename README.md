# People-to-Projects
Motivation usually comes in short bursts for many people at non-predictable times.

When this moment in time arrives, we want people to have a chance to act on this feeling before it becomes a missed opportunity. A missed link between interesting projects and prospective individuals is a total loss on both sides. We aim to solve this problem by expediting the initial interaction between these parties. A person that's either looking for collaborators to their own project or to join another person's project may use People2Projects to instantly start the search for existing endeavours or available expertise in their surrounding area, and commit to their motivation pretty much on command.

This app will allow individuals to search up local projects at any time, which makes it a potential utility to many groups of people including college campuses, larger companies, and one's surrounding community in general.
